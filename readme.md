# Progressive Web Apps - Example Repository

This repository contains simple examples of PWAs, which have been described in my bachelor thesis.

## [1. Installable PWA](01_installable_pwa)

This project demonstrates all the necessary requirements that a website has to fulfill in order to
support the "Add to the homepage" dialog.

## [2. App-like experience](02_app_like_experience)

This project demonstrates how the design of a PWA can be changed by Web App Manifest and meta tags.
